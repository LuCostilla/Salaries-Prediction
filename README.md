# Salaries-Prediction

- Categorized information about Company Size and also group Companies Location into Continents. 

- After I also categorized the Employee residence witht Continents, to have the same importance to the location and residence. 

- Lastly I've created lots of columns using "get dummies" in otrder to categorize the Job Titles. 

The result, has shown that the error of the prediction was +60k that was more or less the average. Therefore I stayed with that prediction
